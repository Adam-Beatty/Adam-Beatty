- 👋 Hi, I’m @Adam-Beatty
- 👀 I’m interested in the seemingly vast abilities of Linux, getting into cybersecurity and meeting likeminded people
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a little bit of everything, studying to take the Security+ exam
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me learn
- 📫 How to reach me a.davis.beatty@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a creative person by nature. Was a screenwriter and film editor but looking for a change and a challenge in my life. I make video glitch art sometimes and I'm a dad to a couple of kiddos.
